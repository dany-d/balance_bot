The objective of this project was to develop and implement a self-balancing bot, to manually and autonomously navigate setpoints and perform various challenges. The system developed was based on embedded system using Beaglebone Green for soft real-time control. This involved implementing concepts of modeling robot dynamics, control of DC motors for balance and motion control using wheel encoders and MEMS IMU sensors using odometric navigation system. The performance of each subsystem was evaluated and discussed. The designed system performs every tasks with high performance and reliability. The bot was ranked 1st in the Ô¨Ånal competition and won 4/5 challenges. Further improvements include incorporating weighted gyrodometry and advanced setpoint positioning techniques.
